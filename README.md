# Games

This repository contains all my game development journey.

Most (if not all) of the games will use the MAGE engine that is part of the repo.

I developed all of them in a Mac with MacOS as primary target. In theory, they should work on other systems, as they use
OpenGL and SDL under the hoods, but I likely didn't test them in neither.
